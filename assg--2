/*Write a c program to print all those numbers from 1 upto n which are divisible by k and also print evensum and oddsum from those divisible.
Example : 
Input: 
20  5
Output:
5 10 15 20
30  20
Explanation:
That means 1 to 20 numbers which are divisible by 5 and among 5,10,15,20 evensum is 30 (10+20), oddsum is 20 (5+15).*/
